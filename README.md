# ISE407

This site is for materials related to the course ISE 407, "Computational Optimization", offered in the Industrial and Systems Engineering Department at Lehigh Univeristy. The main course page is [here](https://lehighisecourses.github.io/ISE407). I'm in the process of adding materials here, so check back over time.
