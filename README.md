This site is for materials related to the course ISE 407, "Computational Optimization", offered in the [Industrial and Systems Engineering Department](https://ise.lehigh.edu) at [Lehigh University](https://www.lehigh.edu). The main course page is [here](https://lehighisecourses.github.io/ISE407). I'm in the process of adding materials here, so check back over time.
